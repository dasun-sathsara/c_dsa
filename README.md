# Algorithms and Data Structures in C

Welcome to my repository of Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in C. This repository is a personal project aimed at exploring and understanding the intricacies of various Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for each algorithm and data structure.
- `tests`: This directory contains the test cases for each implementation in the 'src' directory.
